Skin cancer are classified in two types and predictions are done using convolutional neural network
In order to diagnose skin cancer speedily at the earliest stage and solve some of the aforementioned problems, there has been extensive research solutions by developing computer image analysis algorithms. In this project, an augmented assistance to the dermatologist is provided using deep learning. 

The dataset is taken from the ISIC (International Skin Image Collaboration) Archive. It consists of 700 pictures of benign type skin cancer and 700 pictures of malignant classified type skin cancer. The pictures have all been resized to low resolution (128 x 128 x 3) RGB. The task of this kernel is to create a model, which can classify a skin cancer visually into benign and malignant.
Two types of skin cancer are -
1. Benign

2. Malignant

In this project, 2 different classes of skin cancer are detected and classified using Convolution Neural Network with Keras TensorFlow in backend and the result is analysed to see how the model can be useful in practical scenario.
